Design Document: Universal Observability Automation Platform

Version: 1.0
Date: October 27, 2023
Author: AI Assistant
1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture and phased implementation plan for a universal observability automation platform. The system's primary goal is to ingest alerts from any monitoring source, use a Large Language Model (LLM) to investigate the circumstances, and provide human-readable analysis and actionable remediation steps to on-call engineers.

The core principles of the architecture are decoupling, standardization, and extensibility, ensuring the platform can be integrated into any environment without dependency on a specific monitoring vendor. This is achieved through a pluggable, adapter-based design.
2. High-Level Architecture

The system is composed of several logical layers that process an alert from ingestion to notification.

3. Component Breakdown
3.1. Ingestion Layer

    Purpose: To receive alerts from any source and convert them into a Canonical Alert Format.

    Components:

        Universal Webhook Endpoint: A single HTTP endpoint to receive raw JSON payloads from various monitoring tools.

        Alert Normalizer/Adapter: A module that identifies the source and translates its unique payload into our internal standard format.

    Canonical Alert Format (Example):
    Generated json


    {
      "incident_id": "uuid-v4",
      "source_system": "datadog",
      "service_name": "user-auth-api",
      "severity": "critical",
      "title": "High Latency Detected",
      "description": "p99 latency is 1500ms, exceeding threshold of 800ms.",
      "link_to_source": "https://...",
      "raw_payload": { ... }
    }

3.2. State & Knowledge Database

    Purpose: To provide the LLM with long-term memory, operational context, and historical precedent.

    Components:

        Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB): Stores vector embeddings of unstructured text data. This is crucial for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

        Relational/NoSQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL): Stores structured data like incident state, final reports, user feedback, and application configuration.

3.3. What to Store in the Vector DB

The Vector DB is the "brain" of the system. It should be populated via an automated pipeline (e.g., a Confluence Connector) that scrapes, chunks, and embeds the following:

    High Priority:

        Runbooks & Playbooks: Step-by-step guides for handling specific alerts.

        Post-mortems & Incident Reports: Analyses of past incidents, including root causes and resolutions.

        Service Catalogs: Metadata about services (owner, dependencies, dashboards).

    Medium Priority:

        Resolved Tickets: Captures undocumented fixes from Jira, Zendesk, etc.

        Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): Explains why systems are designed a certain way.

3.4. LLM Investigation Agent & Data Abstraction

    Purpose: To autonomously investigate an alert by reasoning and gathering data.

    Components:

        LLM Agent (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex): An LLM configured to use the "ReAct" (Reason + Act) pattern.

        Data Abstraction Layer: A set of Data Fetching Adapters that provide the LLM with "tools" to query data sources.

    Tool Interface: The agent makes generic requests (e.g., get_logs(service)), and the adapter translates this into a provider-specific query (e.g., Datadog Log Query Syntax, Grafana LogQL). There is no universal query language, so this abstraction is critical.

3.5. Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a Standard

    Concern: How do we standardize the interface between the LLM Agent and its tools?

    Solution: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an ideal choice.

        The LLM Agent acts as an MCP Client.

        The Data Abstraction Layer acts as an MCP Server Gateway.

        For each provider (Datadog, Jira, Slack), we implement a logical MCP Adapter within the gateway. This involves creating a manifest.json (describing the tool) and a handler function (the actual implementation). This approach centralizes logic while keeping provider-specific code modular.

4. Phased Implementation Plan & Milestones
Milestone 1: The "Alert Explainer" (MVP)

    Goal: Prove the core concept and deliver immediate value.

    Features: Single webhook for one provider (e.g., Datadog), stateless LLM call to explain the alert, and notification to one channel (e.g., Slack).

    Tech Stack: Python is highly recommended due to its mature AI/LLM ecosystem. FastAPI for the web server, OpenAI for the LLM.

Milestone 2: The "Contextualizer"

    Goal: Enrich alerts with internal knowledge.

    Features: Implement a Vector DB. Build a Confluence Connector to populate it with runbooks and service metadata. Use RAG to inject this context into the LLM prompt.

Milestone 3: The "Junior Investigator"

    Goal: Enable active data gathering.

    Features: Implement an LLM Agent framework (LangChain). Build the first data fetching adapters (get_logs, get_metrics). The LLM can now form and test hypotheses.

Milestone 4: The "Universal Adapter Platform"

    Goal: Make the system truly extensible and production-ready.

    Features: Formalize the adapter interfaces, potentially using MCP. Add adapters for more monitoring sources and notification channels. Build a configuration system to map services to tools.

Milestone 5: The "Autonomous SRE"

    Goal: Enable closed-loop remediation for safe actions.

    Features: Introduce secure "write" tools (e.g., rollback_deployment). Implement a human-in-the-loop approval workflow in Slack for all automated actions.

5. Broader Use Cases for the Architecture

The Webhook -> Normalize -> LLM Process -> Notify pattern is highly versatile and can be applied to other domains:

    CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring: Explain build/deployment failures from Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.

    Customer Support Ticket Triage: Summarize, categorize, and prioritize new tickets from Zendesk or Jira.

    Security Alert Analysis: Translate cryptic CVE or SIEM alerts, explain their impact, and suggest remediation from Snyk, GuardDuty, etc.

    Cloud Cost Anomaly Detection: Identify and explain sudden spikes in cloud spending.

6. Conclusion

By starting with a focused MVP and iteratively expanding its capabilities, this project can evolve from a simple "Alert Explainer" into a powerful, autonomous platform. The key to its success lies in the adapter-based architecture, which provides universality, and the robust knowledge base, which provides the LLM with the context needed to perform intelligent and accurate investigations. This approach promises to significantly reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), alleviate alert fatigue, and free up valuable engineering resources.
